# Python Devcontainer Template

This template can be used to create a [Visual Studio Code Remote Containers](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers) development container with a [Python](https://www.python.org) project.

The devcontainer is setup via a Dockerfile that installs all foundational things for the development environment.
Docker Compose starts the devcontainer as a service so that adding e.g. a database is easy.
